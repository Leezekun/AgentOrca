Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3. Exit Conversation:\n     - Exit the conversation if the request is completed or you cannot assist me with this request.\n\n\n### Actions with Constraints:\n\n* login_user:\nNone\n\n### Internal Verification Functions:",

For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3. Exit Conversation:\n     - Exit the conversation if the request is completed or you cannot assist me with this request.\n\n\n### Actions with Constraints:\n\n* logout_user:\nThe user parameter key \"username\" **MUST EXIST** as a top-level key in the accounts section of the database.\n\n### Internal Verification Functions:\n\n* internal_check_username_exist",

For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3. Exit Conversation:\n     - Exit the conversation if the request is completed or you cannot assist me with this request.\n\n\n### Actions with Constraints:\n\n* logout_user:\nThe user parameter key \"username\" **MUST EXIST** as a top-level key in the accounts section of the database.\n\n### Internal Verification Functions:\n\n* internal_check_username_exist",

Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3. Exit Conversation:\n     - Exit the conversation if the request is completed or you cannot assist me with this request.\n\n\n### Actions with Constraints:\n\n* login_user:\nNone\n\n* view_order_history:\nThe user is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\n* return_order:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n• The user is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n• The order with order ID \"order_id\" **MUST HAVE** been placed by the user \"username\" to perform this action.\n• The order with order ID \"order_id\" **MUST HAVE** a status of 'Delivered' to perform this action.\n• ANY ONE of these conditions must be met:\n  • The interaction time falls within the allowable return period for the order with ID \"order_id\".

Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3. Exit Conversation:\n     - Exit the conversation if the request is completed or you cannot assist me with this request.\n\n\n### Actions with Constraints:\n\n* login_user:\nNone\n\n* view_cart:\nThe user is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\n### Internal Verification Functions:",

Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3. Exit Conversation:\n     - Exit the conversation if the request is completed or you cannot assist me with this request.\n\n\n### Actions with Constraints:\n\n* login_user:\nNone\n\n* view_order_history:\nThe user is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\n### Internal Verification Functions:",

For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3. Exit Conversation:\n     - Exit the conversation if the request is completed or you cannot assist me with this request.\n\n\n### Actions with Constraints:\n\n* login_user:\nNone\n\n* view_shipping_addresses:\nThe user is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\n### Internal Verification Functions:",
